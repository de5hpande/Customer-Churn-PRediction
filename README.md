# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** app! This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on various features.

## 🔍 About the Project
Customer churn is a critical business problem in many industries like telecommunications, banking, and e-commerce. Predicting churn allows businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers, saving costs and driving growth.

### Key Features:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and interactive experience.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Developed with **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** using TensorFlow to achieve high accuracy.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Upload your dataset or input customer details to get instant predictions on churn likelihood.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the application: [Customer Churn Prediction App](https://customerchurnprediction123.streamlit.app/)
2. Input customer data or upload a dataset.
3. Get insights and predictions with detailed visualizations.

### Example Use Cases:
- Identify customers at risk of leaving.
- Target at-risk customers with personalized offers.
- Analyze factors influencing customer churn.

## 💡 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras** for the ANN model
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data preprocessing
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Streamlit** for deployment

## 🌟 Why This Project?
Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project is a step toward helping businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.
